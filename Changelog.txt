v2.2
	- Got rid of BItmapMovie class, thus simplifying the code.

v2.1
	- Added option to capture a single window. Note that the application
	  remembers the initial window frame, it does not follow the window if
	  it's moved or resized.
	- It was possible to start recording from the Deskbar control when encoding was in progress.
	  This would have caused various problems. Fixed.
	- An alert is shown if the user tries to quit the app and recording or encoding is in progress.
	  The user can force quitting if needed.
	- Added a live indicator of the number of recorded frames
	- Added an Information view, mostly for debugging reasons
	- Improved code which handles the case the destination file already exists
	- Fixed preview image ratio
	- Fixed crash on quit when recording is in progress
	- Fixed crash on quit when encoding is in progress
	- Code cleanup

	- Implement option to hide the Deskbar icon. Stopping the capture

	  by an input-server addon (puckipedia)
	- Fix preview not being updated in various circumstances
	- Moved resizing slider to the main tab view
	- Enlarged the preview area, and hopefully improved layout
